# Purpose

Provide a reference for using TailwindCSS w/ Gatsby

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParamagicDev/tailwind-gatsby-project.git
cd tailwind-gatsby-project
npm install
gatsby develop
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser. You should see tailwind working if
the text "Hi people" has a red background. Feel free submit issues if you would like.
